Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an:

. independent
. equal

contribution to the outcome.
