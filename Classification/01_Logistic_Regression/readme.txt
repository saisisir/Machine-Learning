Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. It's used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a given class. The model delivers a binary or dichotomous outcome limited to two possible outcomes: yes/no, 0/1, or true/false. 

Logistic regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. It's used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.

Few examples of Logistic Regression:

Applying machine learning to determine if a person is likely to be infected with COVID-19 or not
Predicting if an e-mail is spam or not spam
Predicting if a tumor is malignant or not malignant

The equation used in Logistic Regression is (log(p/1-p)\)

Q.) Why Logistic Regression is called Regression even though its a Classification?
A.) Logistic regression uses the same basic formula as linear regression but it is regressing for the probability of a categorical outcome.
Linear regression gives a continuous value of output y for a given input X. Whereas, logistic regression gives a continuous value of P(Y=1) for a given input X, which is later converted to Y=0 or Y=1 based on a threshold value.

That’s the reason, logistic regression has “Regression” in its name.
