AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that can be used in a wide variety of classification and regression tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to classify data by combining multiple weak or base learners (e.g., decision trees) into a strong learner.
