Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables (also known as predictors or features) and a dependent variable (the outcome or response). It is an extension of simple linear regression, which deals with the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable. In multiple linear regression, you have two or more independent variables, and you seek to find a linear relationship that best explains the variation in the dependent variable.

The multiple linear regression model can be expressed mathematically as:

Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βnXn + ε

Where:

Y is the dependent variable.
X1, X2, ..., Xn are the independent variables.
β0 is the intercept (the value of Y when all independent variables are zero).
β1, β2, ..., βn are the coefficients that represent the change in Y for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other independent variables constant.
ε represents the error term, which accounts for the variability in Y that is not explained by the model.
The goal of multiple linear regression is to estimate the coefficients (β0, β1, β2, ..., βn) in such a way that the model provides the best fit to the observed data. This is typically done using a method like least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.

Multiple linear regression is widely used in various fields, such as economics, finance, social sciences, and natural sciences, for tasks like predicting outcomes, understanding the relationships between variables, and making decisions based on data analysis. Before conducting a multiple linear regression analysis, it's important to check the assumptions of the model and assess the significance of the independent variables to ensure the validity of the results.
